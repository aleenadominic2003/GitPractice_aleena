Git is a version control system that helps manage changes to files and coordinate work among multiple people.
Common commands include:
git init: Initializes a new repository.
git clone: Copies an existing repository.
git add: Stages changes for the next commit.
git commit: Saves the staged changes.
git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
Git facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple contributors to work on the same project.
Pull requests are used to propose changes and review code before merging.
